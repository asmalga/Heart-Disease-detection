Heart Disease Detection System
Overview

A machine learning–based system that predicts the presence of heart disease using clinical health parameters. The project focuses on early detection through data-driven analysis.

Objective

To build an efficient ML model that accurately classifies whether a patient is at risk of heart disease.

Technologies Used

Python, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Algorithm: Logistic Regression
Environment: Jupyter Notebook

Dataset

The dataset includes attributes such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol level, fasting blood sugar, ECG results, and maximum heart rate. Data preprocessing involved cleaning, feature selection, and normalization.

Methodology

Data preprocessing → Feature selection → Model training → Evaluation → Prediction

Results

The Logistic Regression model achieved 85% accuracy on test data, showing reliable performance for binary classification.

How to Run
git clone https://github.com/asmalga/Heart-Disease-detection
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn

Open the Jupyter Notebook and run all cells.

Future Scope:
Enhance accuracy using advanced algorithms, hyperparameter tuning, and deploy as a web application.
